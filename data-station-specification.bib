Privacy protection increasingly means the application of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), also known as privacy engineering. Demands for the application of PETs are not yet met with ease of use or even understanding. This paper provides a scope of the current peer-reviewed evidence regarding the practical use or adoption of various PETs for managing health data privacy. We describe the state of knowledge of PETS for the use and exchange of health data specifically and build a practical perspective on the steps needed to improve the standardization of the application of PETs for diverse uses of health data.},

	abstract = {As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?},

Yet, openness may also harm business and societal interests. Literature on platform openness does not cover data platforms, and data economy scholars rarely study platform openness. Therefore, this paper develops a research agenda on the openness of data platforms. We explore how data platforms differ from conventional digital platforms (e.g., software platforms). From those differentiating characteristics, we identify areas for future work: (1) The specific characteristics of data require reconceptualizing the object of platform openness; (2) New ways in which data platforms can be opened should be conceptualized; (3) As data platforms are tailored to specific industries, platform-to-platform openness should be a novel unit of analysis; (4) Because opening up data platforms create novel risks, new reasons to (not) open up data platforms should be studied.},

	abstract = {Big data and machine learning applications focus on retrieving data on a central location for analysis. However, healthcare data can be sensitive in nature and as such difficult to share and make use for secondary purposes. Healthcare vendors are restricted to share data without proper consent from the patient. There is a rising awareness among individual patients as well regarding sharing their personal information due to ethical, legal and societal problems. The current data-sharing platforms in healthcare do not sufficiently handle these issues. The rationale of the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach shifts the focus from sharing data to sharing processing/analysis applications and their respective results. A prerequisite of the PHT-infrastructure is that the data is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The aim of the paper is to describe a methodology of finding the number of patients diagnosed with hypertension and calculate cohort statistics in a privacy-preserving federated manner. The whole process completes without individual patient data leaving the source. For this, we rely on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.},

	abstract = {In recent years, as newer technologies have evolved around the healthcare ecosystem, more and more data have been generated. Advanced analytics could power the data collected from numerous sources, both from healthcare institutions, or generated by individuals themselves via apps and devices, and lead to innovations in treatment and diagnosis of diseases; improve the care given to the patient; and empower citizens to participate in the decision-making process regarding their own health and well-being. However, the sensitive nature of the health data prohibits healthcare organizations from sharing the data. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is a novel approach, aiming to establish a distributed data analytics infrastructure enabling the (re)use of distributed healthcare data, while data owners stay in control of their own data. The main principle of the PHT is that data remain in their original location, and analytical tasks visit data sources and execute the tasks. The PHT provides a distributed, flexible approach to use data in a network of participants, incorporating the FAIR principles. It facilitates the responsible use of sensitive and/or personal data by adopting international principles and regulations. This paper presents the concepts and main components of the PHT and demonstrates how it complies with FAIR principles.},

	abstract = {The requirement for specialization in data management systems has evolved faster than our software development practices. After decades of organic growth, this situation has created a siloed landscape composed of hundreds of products developed and maintained as monoliths, with limited reuse between systems. This fragmentation has resulted in developers often reinventing the wheel, increased maintenance costs, and slowed down innovation. It has also affected the end users, who are often required to learn the idiosyncrasies of dozens of incompatible SQL and non-SQL API dialects, and settle for systems with incomplete functionality and inconsistent semantics. In this vision paper, considering the recent popularity of open source projects aimed at standardizing different aspects of the data stack, we advocate for a paradigm shift in how data management systems are designed. We believe that by decomposing these into a modular stack of reusable components, development can be streamlined while creating a more consistent experience for users. Towards that goal, we describe the state-ofthe-art, principal open source technologies, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will foster collaboration, motivate further research, and promote a more composable future for data management.},

A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes.

	abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems designed for Online Analytical Processing (RDBMS-OLAP) have been foundational to democratizing data and enabling analytical use cases such as business intelligence and reporting for many years. However, RDBMS-OLAP systems present some well-known challenges. They are primarily optimized only for relational workloads, lead to proliferation of data copies which can become unmanageable, and since the data is stored in proprietary formats, it can lead to vendor lock-in, restricting access to engines, tools, and capabilities beyond what the vendor offers. As the demand for data-driven decision making surges, the need for a more robust data architecture to address these challenges becomes ever more critical. Cloud data lakes have addressed some of the shortcomings of RDBMS-OLAP systems, but they present their own set of challenges. More recently, organizations have often followed a two-tier architectural approach to take advantage of both these platforms, leveraging both cloud data lakes and RDBMS-OLAP systems. However, this approach brings additional challenges, complexities, and overhead. This paper discusses how a data lakehouse, a new architectural approach, achieves the same benefits of an RDBMS-OLAP and cloud data lake combined, while also providing additional advantages. We take today's data warehousing and break it down into implementation independent components, capabilities, and practices. We then take these aspects and show how a lakehouse architecture satisfies them. Then, we go a step further and discuss what additional capabilities and benefits a lakehouse architecture provides over an RDBMS-OLAP.},

	abstract = {Multisite medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research. The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data utility. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely upon bespoke data sharing contracts. The lengthy process and administration induced by these contracts increases the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research. 
This paper provides a synthesis between 2 novel advanced privacy-enhancing technologies—homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (defined together as multiparty homomorphic encryption). These privacy-enhancing technologies provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with multiparty homomorphic encryption providing a performance advantage over separately using homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation. We argue multiparty homomorphic encryption fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using multiparty homomorphic encryption can be considered anonymized data. We explain how multiparty homomorphic encryption can reduce the reliance upon customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research while offering additional incentives for health care and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.},

However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

	abstract = {Background
To receive the best care, people share their health data (HD) with their health practitioners (known as sharing HD for primary purposes). However, during the past two decades, sharing for other (i.e., secondary) purposes has become of great importance in numerous fields, including public health, personalized medicine, research, and development. We aimed to conduct the first comprehensive overview of all studies that investigated people's HD sharing attitudes—along with associated barriers/motivators and significant influencing factors—for all data types and across both primary and secondary uses.
Methods
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CINAHL for relevant studies published in English between database inception and February 28, 2023, using a predefined set of keywords. Studies were included, regardless of their design, if they reported outcomes related to attitudes towards sharing HD. We extracted key data from the included studies, including the type of HD involved and findings related to: HD sharing attitudes (either in general or depending on type of data/user); barriers/motivators/benefits/concerns of the study participants; and sociodemographic and other variables that could impact HD sharing behaviour. The qualitative synthesis was conducted by dividing the studies according to the data type (resulting in five subgroups) as well as the purpose the data sharing was focused on (primary, secondary or both). The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of non-randomised studies. This work was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023413822.
Findings
Of 2109 studies identified through our search, 116 were included in the qualitative synthesis, yielding a total of 228,501 participants and various types of HD represented: person-generated HD (n = 17 studies and 10,771 participants), personal HD in general (n = 69 studies and 117,054 participants), Biobank data (n = 7 studies and 27,073 participants), genomic data (n = 13 studies and 54,716 participants), and miscellaneous data (n = 10 studies and 18,887 participants). The majority of studies had a moderate level of quality (83 [71.6\%] of 116 studies), but varying levels of quality were observed across the included studies. Overall, studies suggest that sharing intentions for primary purposes were observed to be high regardless of data type, and it was higher than sharing intentions for secondary purposes. Sharing for secondary purposes yielded variable findings, where both the highest and the lowest intention rates were observed in the case of studies that explored sharing biobank data (98\% and 10\%, respectively). Several influencing factors on sharing intentions were identified, such as the type of data recipient, data, consent. Further, concerns related to data sharing that were found to be mutual for all data types included privacy, security, and data access/control, while the perceived benefits included those related to improvements in healthcare. Findings regarding attitudes towards sharing varied significantly across sociodemographic factors and depended on data type and type of use. In most cases, these findings were derived from single studies and therefore warrant confirmations from additional studies.
Interpretation
Sharing health data is a complex issue that is influenced by various factors (the type of health data, the intended use, the data recipient, among others) and these insights could be used to overcome barriers, address people's concerns, and focus on spreading awareness about the data sharing process and benefits.

	abstract = {Design research (DR) positions information technology artifacts at the core of the Information Systems discipline. However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.},

	abstract = {Background: An essential step in any medical research project after identifying the research question is to determine if there are sufficient patients available for a study and where to find them. Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing.
Objective: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data.
Methods: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service.
Results: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative.
Conclusions: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.},

This paper develops business model archetypes for the full array of data marketplace types, ranging from private to independent ownership and from a hierarchical to a market orientation. Through exploratory interviews and case analyses, we create a business model taxonomy. Patterns in our taxonomy reveal four business model archetypes. We find that privately-owned data marketplaces with hierarchical orientation apply the aggregating data marketplace archetype. Consortium-owned data marketplaces apply the archetypes of aggregating data marketplace with additional brokering service and consulting data marketplace. Independently owned data marketplaces with market orientation apply the facilitating data marketplace archetype. Our results provide a basis for configurational theory that explains the performance of data marketplace business models. Our results also provide a basis for specifying boundary conditions for theory on data marketplace business models, as, for instance, the importance of network effects differs strongly between the archetypes.},

Through 23 qualitative interviews in the automotive industry, we find that MPC (1) enables new ways of technology-based control, (2) reduces the need for inter-organizational trust, and (3) prevents losing competitive advantage due to data leakage. However, MPC also creates the need to trust technology and introduces new risks of data misuse. These impacts arise if firms perceive benefits from sharing data, have high organizational readiness, and perceive data as non-sensitive. Our findings show that known antecedents of data sharing should be specified differently with MPC in place. Furthermore, we suggest reframing MPC as a data collaboration technology beyond enhancing privacy.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of {\textbackslash}federated optimization.},

We present a robust aggregation approach to make federated learning robust to settings when a fraction of the devices may be sending corrupted updates to the server. The approach relies on a robust aggregation oracle based on the geometric median, which returns a robust aggregate using a constant number of iterations of a regular non-robust averaging oracle. The robust aggregation oracle is privacy-preserving, similar to the non-robust secure average oracle it builds upon. We establish its convergence for least squares estimation of additive models. We provide experimental results with linear models and deep networks for three tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. The robust aggregation approach is agnostic to the level of corruption; it outperforms the classical aggregation approach in terms of robustness when the level of corruption is high, while being competitive in the regime of low corruption. Two variants, a faster one with one-step robust aggregation and another one with on-device personalization, round off the paper.},

Emerging privacy-enhancing technologies like multi-party computation (MPC), which allows generating insights while consumers retain data control, are challenging the current understanding of why consumers share their data. In this research-in-progress paper, we develop and evaluate an instrument and experimental design to investigate the impact of MPC on consumers’ willingness to share data and its antecedents. Preliminary analysis from a pre-study (N=300) indicates a good fit for our model. Also, MPC enhances consumers’ control and trust while reducing privacy concerns and risk, ultimately increasing data sharing willingness. The findings suggest that privacy-enhancing technologies significantly affect both the willingness to share data itself and its typical antecedents. The next step will conduct a large-scale online experiment using the developed instruments to evaluate further the impact of MPC on consumers’ willingness to share data.},

	abstract = {Data sharing through data marketplaces, which rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP), can benefit businesses and society. However, many companies and consumers are increasingly reluctant to share data due to mounting concerns over data control and privacy. Emerging privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which enables joint computation to generate insights while keeping the input data private, could address data sharing barriers due to its differences with the traditional data sharing approach relying on a TTP. Thus, MPC could challenge the current understanding of why and how businesses and consumers share data. Nevertheless, whether businesses and consumers would be more willing to share data with MPC in place is unclear, as less attention is given to the socio-technical implications of MPC on data sharing decisions in data marketplaces and its antecedents. This research aimed to theorize the socio-technical implications of MPC on sharing through data marketplaces, by investigating how MPC potentially impacts data sharing antecedents by businesses and individuals. We do so through a mixed-method research design focusing on the automotive industry. Based on interviews with 15 MPC experts, which were structured using a Unified Business Model framework, we explored value propositions enabled by MPC use in data marketplaces. These value propositions allow MPC to potentially impact control, privacy, trust, and risks as antecedents of data sharing decisions in data marketplaces. Subsequently, we interviewed 23 automotive industry experts to investigate the potential impact of MPC use in data marketplaces on control, trust, and risks as antecedents of business data sharing. We then conducted an experiment via an online crowdsourcing platform with 1457 participants to investigate the potential impact of MPC use in data marketplaces on control, privacy, trust, and risks as antecedents of consumer data sharing. In this way, we contribute to the socio-technical understanding of MPC beyond technical perspectives. At the same time, we also demonstrate the relevance of MPC to practitioners by pointing out key aspects that should be considered while exploring the possibility of implementing MPC. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for future studies on understanding the socio-technical implications of MPC on data sharing decisions.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

	abstract = {We apply multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to show, given a database that is secret-shared among multiple mutually distrustful parties, how the parties may obliviously construct a decision tree based on the secret data. We consider data with continuous attributes (i.e., coming from a large domain), and develop a secure version of a learning algorithm similar to the C4.5 or CART algorithms. Previous MPC-based work only focused on decision tree learning with discrete attributes (De Hoogh et al. 2014). Our starting point is to apply an existing generic MPC protocol to a standard decision tree learning algorithm, which we then optimize in several ways. We exploit the fact that even if we allow the data to have continuous values, which a priori might require ﬁxed or ﬂoating point representations, the output of the tree learning algorithm only depends on the relative ordering of the data. By obliviously sorting the data we reduce the number of comparisons needed per node to O(N log2 N ) from the naive O(N 2), where N is the number of training records in the dataset, thus making the algorithm feasible for larger datasets. This does however introduce a problem when duplicate values occur in the dataset, but we manage to overcome this problem with a relatively cheap subprotocol. We show a procedure to convert a sorting network into a permutation network of smaller complexity, resulting in a round complexity of O(log N ) per layer in the tree. We implement our algorithm in the MP-SPDZ framework and benchmark our implementation for both passive and active three-party computation using arithmetic modulo 264. We apply our implementation to a large scale medical dataset of ≈ 290 000 rows using random forests, and thus demonstrate practical feasibility of using MPC for privacy-preserving machine learning based on decision trees for large datasets.},

The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, 𝜇-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

Method: A theoretical framework from literature on collective action theory, platform and business ecosystem concepts was developed to explain what factors influence interorganizational collective action for a common service platform. The framework was tested in a case study of collaborative platform project for independent living services in Finland. Semi-structured interviews with the project managers and the decision makers of involved organizations were the primary source of data collection. Result: Strikingly, interdependency among the organizations was not found to be important for collaboration in this case. Instead, we found that a central organization can play an important role in initiating, facilitating and encouraging collaboration among different parties. Moreover, we found more willingness for collaboration when the platform is aimed to be open to third-parties to complement the platform with additional services. Conclusions: Strategies of the platform leader and openness of the platform towards third parties are the most important drivers for collective action between organizations offering independent living services. Establishing common service platforms for independent living services requires explicit attention to these inter-organizational issues.},

Anchored in interviews with 31 experts in the field of mobile and ICT, qualitative analysis starting from platform leadership to explain the role of mobile service platforms is presented: how operator, device and service provider centric platforms compete, collaborate and open up (or not) for delivering scalable services to the poor. Based on the analysis in this paper, it is portended that although operator centric platforms are in pole position, device centric platform providers, being astute innovators, are positioned to close the lead by presenting alternatives to bridge the gap in developing countries.

A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.},

This fragmentation leads in turn to issues such as inconsistencies in services versus payments, wastage, and notably, care delivered being less than best-practice. Despite the long-standing recognition of interoperable data as a potential solution, efforts in achieving interoperability have been disjointed and inconsistent, resulting in numerous incompatible standards, despite the widespread agreement that fewer standards would enhance interoperability. This paper introduces a framework for understanding health care data needs, discussing the challenges and opportunities of open data standards in the field. It emphasizes the necessity of acknowledging diverse data standards, each catering to specific viewpoints and needs, while proposing a categorization of health care data into three domains, each with its distinct characteristics and challenges, along with outlining overarching design requirements applicable to all domains and specific requirements unique to each domain.},

We seek to prove the reliability of the infrastructure to develop global models without sharing private patient data.Materials and Methods We applied the Personal Health Train (PHT) principles using the Vantage6 software to train a neural network to classify head and neck cancer patients\&amp;rsquo; distant metastasis using federated learning algorithms in a privacy preserving manner. Head and neck cancer patient data from four cohorts were assigned to two data stations. During each training iteration, model weights were averaged and sent back to central node.Results We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and model weights between the centralized and federated learning scenarios. The results showed that our federated infrastructure was able to achieve similar predicting power as in the centralized case. Different federated learning model weights aggregation methods were tested. The experiment results showed that federated learning models reached best performance when we aggregate model weights per epoch.Discussion and Conclusion PHT and FAIR data principles can efficiently calculate quality indicators in a privacy-preserving federated approach and the work can be scaled up both nationally and internationally. Despite this, application of the methodology was largely hampered by ELSI issues. However, the lessons learned from this study can provide other hospitals and researchers to adapt to the process easily and take effective measures in building quality of care infrastructures.},

Therefore, this paper provides an overview of applications in the healthcare domain that benefit from data lakes. We review the literature and structure it according to data sources and players, and we identify applications and future research needs of data lakes in the healthcare domain. Overall, it turned out that all players could benefit from the capabilities of data lakes. We found that data lakes are currently not broadly implemented in the field, and the viewpoint of hospital operators and healthcare insurers seems to be an underresearched topic compared to the other players.},

	title = {{HEALER}: {A} {Data} {Lake} {Architecture} for {Healthcare}},
	abstract = {With the growth of the Internet of Things and the rapid progress of social networks, everything appears to generate data. The ever-increasing number of connected devices is accompanied by a growth of the volume of data, produced at an ever-increasing rate, and this massive flow includes data types that are difficult to process using standard database techniques. One of the most critical scenarios is healthcare, whose activities need to store and manage a variety of data types – reports written in natural language, medical images, genomic data and waveforms of vital signs – which do not have a well-defined structure. In order to benefit from this large amount of complex data, Data Lakes have recently emerged as a solution to grant central storage and flexible analysis for all types of data. However, there is no Data Lake architecture that fits all the possible scenarios, since the architecture depends heavily on the application domain and, so far, there are no Data Lake architectures that support the specific needs of the healthcare domain. This work proposes HEALER: a Data Lake architecture that effectively performs data ingestion, data storage, and data access with the aim of providing a single central repository for efficient storage of different types of healthcare data. The architecture also enables the analysis and querying of the data, which can be loaded into the Data Lake regardless of their format and type. To verify the effectiveness of the architecture, a proof-of-concept of HEALER has been developed, that allows ingestion of various data, performs waveforms processing to make them more interpretable to researchers and analysts, grants access to the saved data and allows the analysis of natural language reports. Finally we studied the performance of the system in each of its main phases: ingestion, processing, data access and analysis. The results lead us to some important considerations to be taken into account when using and configuring the system components.},

	title = {Polymorphic {Encryption} and {Pseudonymisation} for {Personalised} {Healthcare}},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/411},
	abstract = {Polymorphic encryption and Pseudonymisation, abbreviated as PEP, form
a novel approach for the management of sensitive personal data,
especially in health care. Traditional encryption is rather rigid:
once encrypted, only one key can be used to decrypt the data. This
rigidity is becoming an every greater problem in the context of big
data analytics, where different parties who wish to investigate part
of an encrypted data set all need the one key for decryption.

Polymorphic encryption is a new cryptographic technique that solves
these problems. Together with the associated technique of polymorphic
pseudonymisation new security and privacy guarantees can be given
which are essential in areas such as (personalised) healthcare,
medical data collection via self-measurement apps, and more generally
in privacy-friendly identity management and data analytics.

The key ideas of polymorphic encryption are:
1. Directly after generation, data can be encrypted in a
`polymorphic' manner and stored at a (cloud) storage facility in
such a way that the storage provider cannot get access. Crucially,
there is no need to a priori fix who gets to see the data, so that
the data can immediately be protected.

For instance a PEP-enabled self-measurement device will store all its
measurement data in polymorphically encrypted form in a back-end data
base.

2. Later on it can be decided who can decrypt the data. This
decision will be made on the basis of a policy, in which the data
subject should play a key role.

The user of the PEP-enabled device can, for instance, decide that
doctors \$X,Y,Z\$ may at some stage decrypt to use the data in their
diagnosis, or medical researcher groups \$A, B, C\$ may use it for their
investigations, or third parties \$U,V,W\$ may use it for additional
services, etc.

3. This `tweaking' of the encrypted data to make it decryptable by
a specific party can be done in a blind manner. It will have to be
done by a trusted party who knows how to tweak the ciphertext for
whom.

This PEP technology can provide the necessary security and privacy
infrastructure for big data analytics. People can entrust their data
in polymorphically encrypted form, and each time decide later to make
(parts of) it available (decryptable) for specific parties, for
specific analysis purposes. In this way users remain in control, and
can monitor which of their data is used where by whom for which
purposes.

The polymorphic encryption infrastructure can be supplemented with a
pseudonymisation infrastructure which is also polymorphic, and
guarantees that each individual will automatically have different
pseudonyms at different parties and can only be de-pseudonymised by
participants (like medical doctors) who know the original identity.

This white paper provides an introduction to Polymorphic Encryption
and Pseudonymisation (PEP), at different levels of abstraction,
focusing on health care as application area. It contains a general
description of PEP, explaining the basic functionality for laymen,
supplemented by a clarification of the legal framework provided by the
upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European
Union. The paper also contains a more advanced, mathematically
oriented description of PEP, including the underlying cryptographic
primitives, key and pseudonym managment, interaction protocols,
etc. This second part is aimed at readers with a background in
computer security and cryptography. The cryptographic basis for PEP is
ElGamal public key encryption, which is well-known since the mid
1980s. It is the way in which this encryption is used --- with
re-randomisation, re-keying and re-shuffling --- that is new.

The PEP framework is currently elaborated into an open design and open
source (prototype) implementation at Radboud University in Nijmegen,
The Netherlands. The technology will be used and tested in a real-life
medical research project at the Radboud University Medical Center.},

However, the current push towards widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models, including in E2EE systems, raises some serious security concerns.

This work performs a critical examination of the (in)compatibility of AI models and E2EE applications. We explore this on two fronts: (1) the integration of AI “assistants” within E2EE applications, and (2) the use of E2EE data for training AI models. 
We analyze the potential security implications of each, and identify conflicts with the security guarantees of E2EE. Then, we analyze legal implications of integrating AI models in E2EE applications, given how AI integration can undermine the confidentiality that E2EE promises. Finally, we offer a list of detailed recommendations based on our technical and legal analyses, including: technical design choices that must be prioritized to uphold E2EE security; how service providers must accurately represent E2EE security; and best practices for the default behavior of AI features and for requesting user consent. We hope this paper catalyzes an informed conversation on the tensions that arise between the brisk deployment of AI and the security offered by E2EE, and guides the responsible development of new AI features.},

	abstract = {Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients’ map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI.},

	abstract = {The Valley of Death (VoD) reflects a series of challenges facing technology-based companies during their early development stages. Extant literature highlights the need for startups to equip themselves with the tools and resources to manage this turbulent transition. However, the existing frameworks propounded by fellow scholars and practitioners regarding VoD are fragmented, each covering only a few issues in the chasm. Thus, the current article proposes a new and comprehensive model for high technology-based startups. The new model emerged from an in-depth review of 128 scholarly materials and empirical data collected from 30 startups (from artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented realities, internet of things, medical, and cleantech industrial sectors). The model was piloted in three pre-startups. The model adds on the existing VoD frameworks to provide a holistic baseline for future research in this field by presenting different challenges underlying the pre-establishment years of a company while addressing courses of action needed to overcome this perilous transition.},

Since building from scratch is a challenge unfit for a startup, we started by re-using (sometimes unconventionally) existing projects, and then investing in improving the areas that would give us the highest marginal gains for the developer experience. In this work, we review user experience, high-level architecture and tooling decisions, and conclude by sharing plans for future development.},

	abstract = {Norway, Sweden, and Finland may be considered as forerunners in adopting openEHR and moving towards open ecosystems. Cross-organisational data sharing, or data exchange, has historically been the objective in all Nordic countries. The needs to share data finally resulted in national document-based data sharing infrastructures in all Nordic countries. Document-based sharing is, however, somewhat limited, and the need for complementary structured sharing has started to emerge. openEHR projects typically start as data exchange projects and gradually develop into a modular EHR. In the Nordics, however, the dominant EHR market leaders chose openEHR as their own data model and started to modernise their solutions as their own internal decision. This is not necessarily the approach taken in other countries. The Nordic experience shows that in order to build a true ecosystem, it is important to increase awareness amongst all stakeholders. A monolithic solution may seem lucrative unless there is sufficient understanding of the benefits of modularity and openEHR.},

	abstract = {Background: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into health care has the potential to transform the industry, but it also raises ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns. This review paper provides an in-depth examination of the benefits and risks associated with AI in health care, with a focus on issues like biases, transparency, data privacy, and safety.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of incorporating AI in health care. This assessment centers on the potential biases in AI algorithms, transparency challenges, data privacy issues, and safety risks in health care settings.
Methods: Studies included in this review were selected based on their relevance to AI applications in health care, focusing on ethical, regulatory, and safety considerations. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and relevant research papers published in English. Exclusion criteria included non–peer-reviewed articles, editorials, and studies not directly related to AI in health care. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 8 databases: OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Philosopher’s Index, ProQuest Advanced Technologies \&amp; Aerospace, and Wiley Cochrane Library. The search was last updated on June 23, 2023. Results were synthesized using qualitative methods to identify key themes and findings related to the benefits and risks of AI in health care.
Results: The literature search yielded 8796 articles. After removing duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. This review highlights the significant promise that AI holds in health care, such as enhancing health care delivery by providing more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and efficient resource allocation. However, persistent concerns remain, including biases ingrained in AI algorithms, a lack of transparency in decision-making, potential compromises of patient data privacy, and safety risks associated with AI implementation in clinical settings.
Conclusions: In conclusion, while AI presents the opportunity for a health care revolution, it is imperative to address the ethical, regulatory, and safety challenges linked to its integration. Proactive measures are required to ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, striking a balance between innovation and the safeguarding of patient well-being.},

	abstract = {Background: Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into medical education has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes. However, it lacks a comprehensive study depicting the academic performance and status of AI in the medical education domain.
Objective: This study aims to analyze the social patterns, productive contributors, knowledge structure, and clusters since the 21st century.
Methods: Documents were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2024. VOSviewer, Incites, and Citespace were used to analyze the bibliometric metrics, which were categorized by country, institution, authors, journals, and keywords. The variables analyzed encompassed counts, citations, H-index, impact factor, and collaboration metrics.
Results: Altogether, 7534 publications were initially retrieved and 2775 were included for analysis. The annual count and citation of papers exhibited exponential trends since 2018. The United States emerged as the lead contributor due to its high productivity and recognition levels. Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, National University of Singapore, Mayo Clinic, University of Arizona, and University of Toronto were representative institutions in their respective fields. Cureus, JMIR Medical Education, Medical Teacher, and BMC Medical Education ranked as the top four most productive journals. The resulting heat map highlighted several high-frequency keywords, including performance, education, AI, and model. The citation burst time of terms revealed that AI technologies shifted from imaging processing (2000), augmented reality (2013), and virtual reality (2016) to decision-making (2020) and model (2021). Keywords such as mortality and robotic surgery persisted into 2023, suggesting the ongoing recognition and interest in these areas.
Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights and guidance for researchers who are interested in educational technology, as well as recommendations for pioneering institutions and journal submissions. Along with the rapid growth of AI, medical education is expected to gain much more benefits.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is known to be vulnerable to both security and privacy issues. Existing research has focused either on preventing poisoning attacks from users or on concealing the local model updates from the server, but not both. However, integrating these two lines of research remains a crucial challenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat model. In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy guarantees for users and detection against poisoning attacks from them. With a new threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious users, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic encryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner. Then, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of detecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key observation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models for attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to identify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of secure aggregation.},

	abstract = {As digital platforms are dominating the digital economy, complex ecologies of platforms are emerging. While the openness of digital platforms is an important theme in platform studies, the openness between platforms has hardly been studied. This paper explores factors that affect decisions by platform owners to open their platforms to other platforms. The focus is on Internet-of-Things platforms for automotive and healthcare applications. According to the findings, platform owners make trade-offs on whether to open up on a case-by-case basis. We identify a complex array of factors relating to direct benefits and costs (e.g., revenues from selling platform data), indirect benefits (e.g., attractiveness of the focal platform to users) as well as strategic consideration (e.g., improving bargaining power towards other actors). How businesses make trade-offs on these factors depends on market-level context (e.g., maturity of the market and standards) and organizational context (e.g., strategic focus and business objectives). Our findings provide a basis for future studies on the openness between platforms, which will become increasingly important as platforms proliferate in every layer of the digital industry.},

	abstract = {The integration and exchange of information among health organizations and system providers are currently regarded as a challenge. Each organization usually has an internal ecosystem and a proprietary way to store electronic health records of the patient’s history. Recent research explores the advantages of an integrated ecosystem by exchanging information between the different inpatient care actors. Many efforts seek quality in health care, economy, and sustainability in process management. Some examples are reducing medical errors, disease control and monitoring, individualized patient care, and avoiding duplicate and fragmented entries in the electronic medical record. Likewise, some studies showed technologies to achieve this goal effectively and efficiently, with the ability to interoperate data, allowing the interpretation and use of health information. To that end, semantic interoperability aims to share data among all the sectors in the organization, clinicians, nurses, lab, the entire hospital. Therefore, avoiding data silos and keep data regardless of vendors, to exchange the information across organizational boundaries. This study presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of semantic interoperability in electronic health records. We searched seven databases of articles published between 2010 to September 2020. We showed the most chosen scenarios, technologies, and tools employed to solve interoperability problems, and we propose a taxonomy around semantic interoperability in health records. Also, we presented the main approaches to solve the exchange problem of legacy and heterogeneous data across healthcare organizations.},

This approach focuses on the implicit concept that is represented by a data element. The process includes the following steps: identifying concepts, clustering similar concepts and constructing mappings between the clusters using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) and Resource Description Framework (RDF), and enabling the creation of reusable mappings. As proof-of-concept, we applied the approach to five common health data standards - HL7 FHIR, OMOP, CDISC, Phenopackets, and openEHR, across four domains, such as demographics and diagnoses, and nine topics within those domains, such as gender and vital status. These domains and topics are selected to represent the broader range of topics in the health field. For each topic, data elements were found in the health data standards after a thorough search, resulting in the analysis of 64 data elements, identification of their underlying concepts, and development of mappings. Three use cases were implemented to demonstrate the role of data element concepts in data harmonization and data querying at varying levels of granularity. The approach helps overcome the limitations of context-dependent mappings and provides valuable insight for mapping practice within the health domain.},

However, in using such data researchers often encounter hurdles–both technical, such as differing data security requirements, and social, such as the terms of informed consent, legal requirements and patient and public trust. Federated or distributed data networks have been proposed and adopted in response to these hurdles. However, to date there has been little consideration of how FDNs respond to both technical and social constraints on data use.

	abstract = {Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99\% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.},

Although there have been attempts at data sharing with the community, initiatives are still limited. In this context, a French task force composed of Integrated Cancer Research Sites (SIRICs), comprehensive cancer centers from the Unicancer network (one of Europe's largest cancer research organization), and university hospitals launched an initiative to improve and accelerate retrospective and prospective clinical and genomic data sharing in oncology.Materials and MethodsFor 5 years, the OSIRIS group has worked on structuring data and identifying technical solutions for collecting and sharing them. The group used a multidisciplinary approach that included weekly scientific and technical meetings over several months to foster a national consensus on a minimal data set.ResultsThe resulting OSIRIS set and event-based data model, which is able to capture the disease course, was built with 67 clinical and 65 omics items. The group made it compatible with the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format to maximize interoperability. The OSIRIS set was reviewed, approved by a National Plan Strategic Committee, and freely released to the community. A proof-of-concept study was carried out to put the OSIRIS set and Common Data Model into practice using a cohort of 300 patients.ConclusionUsing a national and bottom-up approach, the OSIRIS group has defined a model including a minimal set of clinical and genomic data that can be used to accelerate data sharing produced in oncology. The model relies on clear and formally defined terminologies and, as such, may also benefit the larger international community.},

	abstract = {In the context of data analytics, so-called lakehouses refer to novel variants of data platforms that attempt to combine characteristics of data warehouses and data lakes. In this way, lakehouses promise to simplify enterprise analytics architectures, which often suffer from high operational costs, slow analytical processes and further shortcomings resulting from data replication. However, different views and notions on the lakehouse paradigm exist, which are commonly driven by individual technologies and varying analytical use cases. Therefore, it remains unclear what challenges lakehouses address, how they can be characterized and which technologies can be leveraged to implement them. This paper addresses these issues by providing an extensive overview of concepts and technologies that are related to the lakehouse paradigm and by outlining lakehouses as a distinct architectural approach for data platforms. Concepts and technologies from literature with regard to lakehouses are discussed, based on which a conceptual foundation for lakehouses is established. In addition, several popular technologies are evaluated regarding their suitability for the building of lakehouses. All findings are supported and demonstrated with the help of a representative analytics scenario. Typical challenges of conventional data platforms are identified, a new, sharper definition for lakehouses is proposed and technical requirements for lakehouses are derived. As part of an evaluation, these requirements are applied to several popular technologies, of which frameworks for data lakes turn out to be particularly helpful for the construction of lakehouses. Our work provides an overview of the state of the art and a conceptual foundation for the lakehouse paradigm, which can support future research.},

The Lakehouse architecture offers the necessary features for optimal functionality and has gained significant attention in the big data management research community.

To lessen the prohibitive costs of conducting these studies and support evidence-based medicine, results emanating from these studies need to be shared and compared to one another.

Methods: The objective of this paper is to present a proposal for a clinical study architecture to not only facilitate the communication of clinical study data but also its context so that the data that is being communicated can be unambiguously understood at the receiving end. Our approach is two-fold. First we outline our methodology to map clinical data from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Operational Data Model (ODM) to the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource (FHIR) and outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Next, we propose two FHIR-based models, to capture the metadata and data from the clinical study, that not only facilitate the syntactic but also semantic interoperability of clinical study data.
Conclusions: This work shows that our proposed FHIR resources provide a good fit to semantically enrich the ODM data. By exploiting the rich information model in FHIR, we can organise clinical data in a manner that preserves its organisation but captures its context. Our implementations demonstrate that FHIR can natively manage clinical data. Furthermore, by providing links at several levels, it improves the traversal and querying of the data. The intended benefits of this approach is more efficient and effective data exchange that ultimately will allow clinicians to switch their focus back to decision-making and evidence-based medicines.},

This study delves into the substantial role played by major technology conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet), in the ‘industrialisation of artificial intelligence’. This concept encapsulates the shift of AI technologies from the research and development stage to practical, real-world applications across diverse industry sectors, resulting in new dependencies and associated investments. We employ the term ‘Big AI’ to encapsulate the structural convergence of AI and Big Tech, characterised by the profound interdependence of AI with the infrastructure, resources, and investments of these major technology companies. Using a ‘technographic’ approach, our study scrutinises the infrastructural support and investments of Big Tech in the AI sector, focussing on corporate partnerships, acquisitions, and financial investments. Additionally, we conduct a detailed examination of the complete spectrum of cloud platform products and services offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. We demonstrate that AI is not merely an abstract idea but an actual technology stack encompassing infrastructure, models, applications, and an ecosystem of applications and companies relying on this stack. Significantly, these tech giants have seamlessly integrated all three components of the stack into their cloud offerings. Furthermore, they have developed industry-focussed solutions and marketplaces aimed at attracting third-party developers and businesses, fostering the growth of a broader AI ecosystem. This analysis underscores the intricate interdependence between AI and cloud infrastructure, emphasising the industry-specific aspects of cloud AI.},

Business partnerships are endemic and essential to the business of platforms, yet their role remains relatively underexplored in the literature on platformisation and platform power. This article considers the significance of partnerships in the social media ecosystem to better understand how industry platforms, and the infrastructure they build, mediate and shape platform power and governance. We argue that partners contribute to ‘platformisation’ through their collective development of business-to-business platform infrastructures. Specifically, we examine how partners have integrated social media platforms with what we call the audience economy – an exceptionally complex global and interconnected marketplace of intermediaries involved in the creation, commodification, analysis, and circulation of data audiences for purposes including but not limited to digital advertising and marketing. We determined which relationships are involved, which are exclusive or shared, and identified key ecosystem partners. Further, we found that partners build and integrate extensive infrastructures for data-sourcing and media distribution, surfacing infrastructural and strategic sources and locations, or ‘nodes’, of power in this ecosystem. The empirical findings thus highlight the significance of partnerships and partner integrations and draw attention to the powerful industry players and intermediaries that remain largely invisible.},

The BYOD workshops’ content and format differ depending on their goal, context, and the background and needs of participants. Data-focused BYODs educate domain experts on how to make their data FAIR to find new answers to research questions. Management-focused BYODs promote the benefits of making data FAIR and instruct project managers and policy-makers on the characteristics of FAIRification projects. Software-focused BYODs gather software developers and experts on FAIR to implement or improve software resources that are used to support FAIRification. Overall, these BYODs intend to foster collaboration between different types of stakeholders involved in data management, curation, and reuse (e.g. domain experts, trainers, developers, data owners, data analysts, FAIR experts). The BYODs also serve as an opportunity to learn what kind of support for FAIRification is needed from different communities and to develop teaching materials based on practical examples and experience. In this paper, we detail the three different structures of the BYODs and describe examples of early BYODs related to plant breeding data, and rare disease registries and biobanks, which have shaped the structure of the workshops. We discuss the latest insights into making BYODs more productive by leveraging our almost ten years of training experience in these workshops, including successes and encountered challenges. Finally, we examine how the participants’ feedback has motivated the research on FAIR, including the development of workflows and software.},

	abstract = {The development of platforms for distributed analytics has been driven by a growing need to comply with various governance-related or legal constraints. Among these platforms, the so-called Personal Health Train (PHT) is one representative that has emerged over the recent years. However, in projects that require data from sites featuring different PHT infrastructures, institutions are facing challenges emerging from the combination of multiple PHT ecosystems, including data governance, regulatory compliance, or the modification of existing workflows. In these scenarios, the interoperability of the platforms is preferable. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework for the technical interoperability of the PHT covering five essential requirements: Data integration, unified station identifiers, mutual metadata, aligned security protocols, and business logic. We evaluated our concept in a feasibility study that involves two distinct PHT infrastructures: PHT-meDIC and PADME. We analyzed data on leukodystrophy from patients in the University Hospitals of Tübingen and Leipzig, and patients with differential diagnoses at the University Hospital Aachen. The results of our study demonstrate the technical interoperability between these two PHT infrastructures, allowing researchers to perform analyses across the participating institutions. Our method is more space-efficient compared to the multi-homing strategy, and it shows only a minimal time overhead.},

Despite this, standardization to guarantee the integration and reproducibility of the numerical descriptors generated by each domain, e.g. radiomic, pathomic and -omic features, is still an open challenge. Based on specific use cases and scenarios, an integration model, based on the JSON format, is proposed that can help address this problem. Ultimately, this work shows how, with specific standardization and promotion efforts, the digital biobank model can become an enabling technology for the comprehensive study of diseases and the effective development of data-driven technologies at the service of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Data models are crucial for clinical research as they enable researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research.
Objective: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers.
Methods: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies.
Results: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was “Observation” followed by “Condition” and “Patient.” The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability.
Conclusions: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              The FAIR principles recommend the use of controlled vocabularies, such as ontologies, to define data and metadata concepts. Ontologies are currently modelled following different approaches, sometimes describing conflicting definitions of the same concepts, which can affect interoperability. To cope with that, prior literature suggests organising ontologies in levels, where domain specific (low-level) ontologies are grounded in domain independent high-level ontologies (i.e., foundational ontologies). In this level-based organisation, foundational ontologies work as translators of intended meaning, thus improving interoperability. Despite their considerable acceptance in biomedical research, there are very few studies testing foundational ontologies. This paper describes a systematic literature mapping that was conducted to understand how foundational ontologies are used in biomedical research and to find empirical evidence supporting their claimed (dis)advantages.
            
            
              Results
              From a set of 79 selected papers, we identified that foundational ontologies are used for several purposes: ontology construction, repair, mapping, and ontology-based data analysis. Foundational ontologies are claimed to improve interoperability, enhance reasoning, speed up ontology development and facilitate maintainability. The complexity of using foundational ontologies is the most commonly cited downside. Despite being used for several purposes, there were hardly any experiments (1 paper) testing the claims for or against the use of foundational ontologies. In the subset of 49 papers that describe the development of an ontology, it was observed a low adherence to ontology construction (16 papers) and ontology evaluation formal methods (4 papers).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our findings have two main implications. First, the lack of empirical evidence about the use of foundational ontologies indicates a need for evaluating the use of such artefacts in biomedical research. Second, the low adherence to formal methods illustrates how the field could benefit from a more systematic approach when dealing with the development and evaluation of ontologies. The understanding of how foundational ontologies are used in the biomedical field can drive future research towards the improvement of ontologies and, consequently, data FAIRness. The adoption of formal methods can impact the quality and sustainability of ontologies, and reusing these methods from other fields is encouraged.},

An important barrier is the lack of well-designed, vendor-neutral and future-proof infrastructures for deployment. Because current AI algorithms are very narrow in scope, it is expected that a typical hospital will deploy many algorithms concurrently. Managing stand-alone point solutions for all of these algorithms will be unmanageable. A solution to this problem is a dedicated platform for deployment of AI. Here we describe a blueprint for such a platform and the high-level design and implementation considerations of such a system that can be used clinically as well as for research and development. Close collaboration between radiologists, data scientists, software developers and experts in hospital IT as well as involvement of patients is crucial in order to successfully bring AI to the clinic.},

In our integrated workflow, the client systems (including order placer, scheduler, imaging modality, viewer, and report creator) use standard FHIR and DICOMweb APIs. The proposed scheme also facilitates the creation of reports formatted as standard FHIR resources. This paper leverages W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to record the image graphic annotations, and encapsulates the SVG image annotation in FHIR observation. FHIR DiagnosticReports and Observations are used to encapsulate reports, findings, and annotations, thereby facilitating the implementation and integration of the scheme within existing structures. The proposed scheme also provides the potential to make it possible to convert results of Computer Aided Detection/Diagnosis from medical images into FHIR DiagnosticReports and Observations to be stored on a FHIR server. The resulting web-based solution uses FHIR XML and/or JSON data to record and exchange information related to imaging workflow. It can also be used to store imaging reports, findings, and annotations linked to the images using the DICOM WADO-RS protocol. As a result, it is possible to integrate all information that is created in medical imaging workflow. Finally, the proposed scheme is easily integrated with other FHIR systems.},

	abstract = {Oncology patients often face complex choices between treatment regimens with different risk-benefit ratios. The 4D PICTURE (Producing Improved Cancer Outcomes Through User-Centered Research) project aims to support patients, their families, and clinicians with these complex decisions by developing data-driven decision support tools (DSTs) for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma as part of care path redesign using a methodology called MetroMapping. There are myriad ethical issues to consider as the project will create data-driven prognostic models and develop conversation tools using artificial intelligence while including patient perspectives by setting up boards of experiential experts in 8 different countries. This paper aims to review the key ethical challenges related to the design and development of DSTs in oncology. To explore the ethics of DSTs in cancer care, the project adopted the Embedded Ethics approach—embedding ethicists into research teams to sensitize team members to ethical aspects and assist in reflecting on those aspects throughout the project. We conducted what we call an embedded review of the project drawing from key literature on topics related to the different work packages of the 4D PICTURE project, whereas the analysis was an iterative process involving discussions with researchers in the project. Our review identified 13 key ethical challenges related to the development of DSTs and the redesigning of care paths for more personalized cancer care. Several ethical aspects were related to general potential issues of data bias and privacy but prompted specific research questions, for instance, about the inclusion of certain demographic variables in models. Design methodology in the 4D PICTURE project can provide insights related to design justice, a novel consideration in health care DSTs. Ethical points of attention related to health care policy, such as cost-effectiveness, financial sustainability, and environmental impact, were also identified, along with challenges in the research process itself, emphasizing the importance of epistemic justice, the role of embedded ethicists, and psychological safety. This viewpoint highlights ethical aspects previously neglected in the digital health ethics literature and zooms in on real-world challenges in an ongoing project. It underscores the need for researchers and leaders in data-driven medical research projects to address ethical challenges beyond the scientific core of the project. More generally, our tailored review approach provides a model for embedding ethics into large data-driven oncology research projects from the start, which helps ensure that technological innovations are designed and developed in an appropriate and patient-centered manner.},

	abstract = {Background: Although health economic evaluations (HEEs) are increasingly common for therapeutic interventions, they appear to be rare for the use of risk prediction models (PMs). Objectives: To evaluate the current state of HEEs of PMs by performing a comprehensive systematic review. Methods: Four databases were searched for HEEs of PM-based strategies. Two reviewers independently selected eligible articles. A checklist was compiled to score items focusing on general characteristics of HEEs of PMs, model characteristics and quality of HEEs, evidence on PMs typically used in the HEEs, and the speciﬁc challenges in performing HEEs of PMs. Results: After screening 791 abstracts, 171 full texts, and reference checking, 40 eligible HEEs evaluating 60 PMs were identiﬁed. In these HEEs, PM strategies were compared with current practice (n ¼ 32; 80\%), to other stratiﬁcation methods for patient management (n ¼ 19; 48\%), to an extended PM (n ¼ 9; 23\%), or to alternative PMs (n ¼ 5; 13\%). The PMs guided decisions on treatment (n ¼ 42; 70\%), further testing (n ¼ 18; 30\%), or treatment prioritization (n ¼ 4; 7\%). For 36 (60\%) PMs, only a single decision threshold was evaluated. Costs of risk prediction were ignored for 28 (46\%) PMs. Uncertainty in outcomes was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses in 22 (55\%) HEEs. Conclusions: Despite the huge number of PMs in the medical literature, HEE of PMs remains rare. In addition, we observed great variety in their quality and methodology, which may complicate interpretation of HEE results and implementation of PMs in practice. Guidance on HEE of PMs could encourage and standardize their application and enhance methodological quality, thereby improving adequate use of PM strategies.},

However, these highly complex systems are sensitive to changes in the environment and liable to performance decay. Even after their successful integration into clinical practice, ML/AI algorithms should be continuously monitored and updated to ensure their long-term safety and effectiveness. To bring AI into maturity in clinical care, we advocate for the creation of hospital units responsible for quality assurance and improvement of these algorithms, which we refer to as “AI-QI” units. We discuss how tools that have long been used in hospital quality assurance and quality improvement can be adapted to monitor static ML algorithms. On the other hand, procedures for continual model updating are still nascent. We highlight key considerations when choosing between existing methods and opportunities for methodological innovation.},

We argue that open standards are a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve health data interoperability. The ecosystem of open-source software needs to be considered when choosing an appropriate standard for a given context. We discuss two specific contexts, namely standardization of (1) health data for federated learning, and (2) health data sharing in low- and middle-income countries. Specific design principles, practical considerations, and implementation choices for these two contexts are described, based on ongoing work in both areas. In the case of federated learning, we observe convergence toward OMOP and FHIR, where the two standards can effectively be used side-by-side given the availability of mediators between the two. In the case of health information exchanges in low and middle-income countries, we see a strong convergence toward FHIR as the primary standard. We propose practical guidelines for context-specific adaptation of open health data standards.},

In the context of the EUCAIM (Cancer Image Europe) project, semantic interoperability among various heterogeneous cancer image data models is required to support the communication, integration, and sharing of data in a standardized and structured way. For this purpose, hyper-ontology is developed as a common semantic metamodel that bridges the disparate imaging and clinical knowledge of the various repositories in EUCAIM and supports their integration. EUCAIM’s hyper-ontology is also an application-based ontology targeted for federated semantic querying and image annotation. To facilitate the hyper-ontology building process and ensure the extensibility of the ontology model, an iterative hybrid well-founded approach that divides the ontology structure into layers and modules is established.},

Health Level Seven (HL7) provides standards for health care data, while the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) provides standards for research data. Bridging these worlds and leveraging health data has the potential to enhance knowledge and data quality, while reducing delays and cost in clinical trials.Objectives The aim was to provide an overview of the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) to CDISC Joint Mapping Implementation Guide (IG) development. The ultimate aim is to increase awareness of this rich resource.MethodsA gap analysis was performed to assess the possibility and feasibility of mapping from FHIR to the CDISC’s Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) standards. The mapping of CDISC domains commenced using FHIRPath, a path-based navigation and extraction language. The domains mapped were Medical History (MH), Concomitant Medications (CM), Procedures (PR), Vital Signs (VS), Laboratory (LB), Adverse Events (AE), and Demographics (DM). The proposed mappings were evaluated through a formal review process.ResultsThe review process consisted of a CDISC Internal Review and a simultaneous CDISC Public Review and HL7 Ballot Review.\&nbsp; A total of 363 comments were obtained from the following reviews: 1) CDISC Internal Review (268), and 2) simultaneous Public Review (95) - CDISC (37), HL7 (58). The predominant gathered in the review included mapping updates, terminology, and requests for greater detail.ConclusionThe HL7 FHIR®\&nbsp;to CDISC Joint Mapping Implementation Guide (IG) provides a rich resource for bridging health care and research standards that can be used with CDISC LB to LOINC mapping guide for leveraging real-world data for clinical trials. The guide assists stakeholders in utilizing health data through the HL7 FHIR® resources to CDISC, CDASH, and SDTM variables. As the community uses this resource, it will continue to mature and potentially expand into new domains.},

	abstract = {Shielding neural networks (NNs) from untrusted hosts with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) has been increasingly adopted. Nevertheless, this paper shows that the confidentiality of NNs and user data is compromised by the recently disclosed ciphertext side channels in TEEs, which leak memory write patterns of TEE-shielded NNs to malicious hosts. While recent works have used ciphertext side channels to recover cryptographic key bits, the technique does not apply to NN inputs which are more complex and only have partial information leaked. We propose an automated input recovery framework, CipherSteal, and for the first time demonstrate the severe threat of ciphertext side channels to NN inputs. CipherSteal novelly recasts the input recovery as a two-step approach — information transformation and reconstruction — and proposes optimizations to fully utilize partial input information leaked in ciphertext side channels. We evaluate CipherSteal on diverse NNs (e.g., Transformer) and image/video inputs, and successfully recover visually identical inputs under different levels of attacker’s pre-knowledge towards the target NNs and their inputs. We comprehensively evaluate two popular NN frameworks, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and NN executables generated by two recent NN compilers, TVM and Glow, and study their different attack surfaces. Moreover, we further steal the target NN’s functionality by training a surrogate NN with our recovered inputs, and also leverage the surrogate NN to generate "white-box" adversarial examples, effectively manipulating the target NN’s predictions.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Access to healthcare data is indispensable for scientiﬁc progress and innovation. Sharing healthcare data is time-consuming and notoriously difﬁcult due to privacy and regulatory concerns. The Personal Health Train (PHT) provides a privacy-by-design infrastructure connecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data sources and allows distributed data analysis and machine learning. Patient data never leaves a healthcare institute. Materials and methods: Lung cancer patient-speciﬁc databases (tumor staging and post-treatment survival information) of oncology departments were translated according to a FAIR data model and stored locally in a graph database. Software was installed locally to enable deployment of distributed machine learning algorithms via a central server. Algorithms (MATLAB, code and documentation publicly available) are patient privacy-preserving as only summary statistics and regression coefﬁcients are exchanged with the central server. A logistic regression model to predict post-treatment two-year survival was trained and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), root mean square prediction error (RMSE) and calibration plots.
Results: In 4 months, we connected databases with 23 203 patient cases across 8 healthcare institutes in 5 countries (Amsterdam, Cardiff, Maastricht, Manchester, Nijmegen, Rome, Rotterdam, Shanghai) using the PHT. Summary statistics were computed across databases. A distributed logistic regression model predicting post-treatment two-year survival was trained on 14 810 patients treated between 1978 and 2011 and validated on 8 393 patients treated between 2012 and 2015.
Conclusion: The PHT infrastructure demonstrably overcomes patient privacy barriers to healthcare data sharing and enables fast data analyses across multiple institutes from different countries with different regulatory regimens. This infrastructure promotes global evidence-based medicine while prioritizing patient privacy.},

	abstract = {The Valley of Death (VoD) reflects a series of challenges facing technology-based companies during their early development stages. Extant literature highlights the need for startups to equip themselves with the tools and resources to manage this turbulent transition. However, the existing frameworks propounded by fellow scholars and practitioners regarding VoD are fragmented, each covering only a few issues in the chasm. Thus, the current article proposes a new and comprehensive model for high technology-based startups. The new model emerged from an in-depth review of 128 scholarly materials and empirical data collected from 30 startups (from artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented realities, internet of things, medical, and cleantech industrial sectors). The model was piloted in three pre-startups. The model adds on the existing VoD frameworks to provide a holistic baseline for future research in this field by presenting different challenges underlying the pre-establishment years of a company while addressing courses of action needed to overcome this perilous transition.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being proposed in ophthalmology, motivated by the variety and amount of clinical and imaging data, as well as their potential benefits at the different stages of patient care. Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.},

The present paper introduces the set of concepts used to describe the European data sources involved in the ConcePTION project and illustrates the ConcePTION Common Data Model (CDM), which serves as the keystone of the federated ConcePTION network. Based on data availability and content analysis of 21 European data sources, the ConcePTION CDM has been structured with six tables designed to capture data from routine healthcare, three tables for data from public health surveillance activities, three curated tables for derived data on population (e.g., observation time and mother‐child linkage), plus four metadata tables. By its first anniversary, the ConcePTION CDM has enabled 13 data sources to run common scripts to contribute to major European projects, demonstrating its capacity to facilitate effective and transparent deployment of distributed analytics, and its potential to address questions about utilization, effectiveness, and safety of medicines in special populations, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and, more broadly, in the general population.},

Results. Polars is more energy-efficient than Pandas when manipulating large dataframes. For small dataframes, the TPCH Benchmarking DATs does not show significant differences, while for the Synthetic DATs, Polars performs significantly better. We identified strong positive correlations between energy usage and execution time, as well as memory usage for Pandas, while Polars did not show significant memory usage correlations for the majority of runs. There is a significantly negative correlation between energy usage and CPU usage for Pandas.
Conclusions. We recommend using Polars for energy-efficient and fast data analysis, emphasizing the importance of CPU core utilization in library selection.

	abstract = {Scientific advances, especially in the healthcare domain, can be accelerated by making data available for analysis. However, in traditional data analysis systems, data need to be moved to a central processing unit that performs analyses, which may be undesirable, e.g. due to privacy regulations in case these data contain personal information. This paper discusses the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach in which data processing is brought to the (personal health) data rather than the other way around, allowing (private) data accessed to be controlled, and to observe ethical and legal concerns. This paper introduces the PHT architecture and discusses the data staging solution that allows processing to be delegated to components spawned in a private cloud environment in case the (health) organisation hosting the data has limited resources to execute the required processing. This paper shows the feasibility and suitability of the solution with a relatively simple, yet representative, case study of data analysis of Covid-19 infections, which is performed by components that are created on demand and run in the Amazon Web Services platform. This paper also shows that the performance of our solution is acceptable, and that our solution is scalable. This paper demonstrates that the PHT approach enables data analysis with controlled access, preserving privacy and complying with regulations such as GDPR, while the solution is deployed in a private cloud environment.},

	abstract = {The validity of epidemiologic findings can be increased using triangulation, i.e. comparison of findings across contexts, and by having sufficiently large amounts of relevant data to analyse. However, access to data is often constrained by practical considerations and by ethico-legal and data governance restrictions. Gaining access to such data can be time-consuming due to the governance requirements associated with data access requests to institutions in different jurisdictions.DataSHIELD is a software solution that enables remote analysis without the need for data transfer (federated analysis). DataSHIELD is a scientifically mature, open-source data access and analysis platform aligned with the ‘Five Safes’ framework, the international framework governing safe research access to data. It allows real-time analysis while mitigating disclosure risk through an active multi-layer system of disclosure-preventing mechanisms. This combination of real-time remote statistical analysis, disclosure prevention mechanisms, and federation capabilities makes DataSHIELD a solution for addressing many of the technical and regulatory challenges in performing the large-scale statistical analysis of health and biomedical data. This paper describes the key components that comprise the disclosure protection system of DataSHIELD. These broadly fall into three classes: (i) system protection elements, (ii) analysis protection elements, and (iii) governance protection elements.Information about the DataSHIELD software is available in https://datashield.org/ and https://github.com/datashield.},

This challenge is even more pronounced in the scenario where a multi-center effort for collaborative omics studies is necessary. OmicSHIELD is introduced as an open-source tool aimed at overcoming these challenges by enabling privacy-protected federated analysis of sensitive omic data. In order to ensure this, multiple security mechanisms have been included in the software. This innovative tool is capable of managing a wide range of omic data analyses specifically tailored to biomedical research. These include genome and epigenome wide association studies and differential gene expression analyses. OmicSHIELD is designed to support both meta- and mega-analysis, so that it offers a wide range of capabilities for different analysis designs. We present a series of use cases illustrating some examples of how the software addresses real-world analyses of omic data.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare and medicine have increased in recent years. To enable access to personal data, Trusted Research Environments (TREs) (otherwise known as Safe Havens) provide safe and secure environments in which researchers can access sensitive personal data and develop AI (in particular machine learning (ML)) models. However, currently few TREs support the training of ML models in part due to a gap in the practical decision-making guidance for TREs in handling model disclosure. Specifically, the training of ML models creates a need to disclose new types of outputs from TREs. Although TREs have clear policies for the disclosure of statistical outputs, the extent to which trained models can leak personal training data once released is not well understood.
Background
We review, for a general audience, different types of ML models and their applicability within healthcare. We explain the outputs from training a ML model and how trained ML models can be vulnerable to external attacks to discover personal data encoded within the model.
Risks
We present the challenges for disclosure control of trained ML models in the context of training and exporting models from TREs. We provide insights and analyse methods that could be introduced within TREs to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches when disclosing trained models.
Discussion
Although specific guidelines and policies exist for statistical disclosure controls in TREs, they do not satisfactorily address these new types of output requests; i.e., trained ML models. There is significant potential for new interdisciplinary research opportunities in developing and adapting policies and tools for safely disclosing ML outputs from TREs.},

	abstract = {Background Use of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) allows the rapidly growing number of biomedical datasets to be optimally (re)used. An important aspect of the FAIR principles is metadata. The FAIR Data Point specifications and reference implementation have been designed as an example on how to publish metadata according to the FAIR principles. Various tools to create metadata have been created, but many of these have limitations, such as interfaces that are not intuitive, metadata that does not adhere to a common metadata schema, limited scalability, and inefficient collaboration. We aim to address these limitations in the FAIR Data Point Populator.
Results The FAIR Data Point Populator consists of a GitHub workflow together with Excel templates that have tooltips, validation and documentation. The Excel templates are targeted towards non-technical users, and can be used collaboratively in online spreadsheet software. A more technical user then uses the GitHub workflow to read multiple entries in the Excel sheets, and transform it into machine readable metadata. This metadata is then automatically uploaded to a connected FAIR Data Point. We applied the FAIR Data Point Populator on the metadata of two datasets, and a patient registry. We were then able to run a query on the FAIR Data Point Index, in order to retrieve one of the datasets.
Conclusion The FAIR Data Point Populator addresses several limitations of other tools. It makes creating metadata easier, ensures adherence to a common metadata schema, allows bulk creation of metadata entries and increases collaboration. As a result of this, the barrier of entry for FAIRification is lower, which enables the creation of FAIR data by more people.},

	abstract = {The emerging paradigm of data economy can constitute an unmissable and attractive opportunity for companies that aim to consider their data as valuable assets. To fully leverage this opportunity, data owners need to have specific and precise guarantees regarding the protection of data they share from unauthorized access, but also from their misuse. Thus, it becomes crucial to provide mechanisms for secure and trusted data sharing capable of protecting data ownership rights and specifying agreed-upon methods of use. In this sense, data space technology can represent a promising and innovative solution in data management that aims to promote effective and trusted data exchange and sharing. By providing standardized technologies and legal frameworks, data spaces seek to eliminate barriers to data sharing among companies and organizations and, ultimately, fostering the development of innovative value-added services. By promoting interoperability and data sovereignty, data spaces play a crucial role in enhancing collaboration and innovation in the data economy. In this paper, the key European initiatives are collected and organized, with the goal of identifying the most recent advances in the direction of harmonizing the specifications, to facilitate the seamless integration between different solutions and foster secure, flexible and scalable data spaces implementations. The results of this study provide guidelines that can support data space designers in driving the choice of the most proper technical specifications to adopt, among the available open-source solutions.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of data protection regulations, the need for innovative privacy-preserving approaches to process and analyse sensitive data has become apparent. One approach is the Personal Health Train (PHT) that brings analysis code to the data and conducts the data processing at the data premises. However, despite its demonstrated success in various studies, the execution of external code in sensitive environments, such as hospitals, introduces new research challenges because the interactions of the code with sensitive data are often incomprehensible and lack transparency. These interactions raise concerns about potential effects on the data and increases the risk of data breaches. To address this issue, this work discusses a PHT-aligned security and audit pipeline inspired by DevSecOps principles. The automated pipeline incorporates multiple phases that detect vulnerabilities. To thoroughly study its versatility, we evaluate this pipeline in two ways. First, we deliberately introduce vulnerabilities into a PHT. Second, we apply our pipeline to five real-world PHTs, which have been utilised in real-world studies, to audit them for potential vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that our designed pipeline successfully identifies potential vulnerabilities and can be applied to real-world studies. In compliance with the requirements of the GDPR for data management, documentation, and protection, our automated approach supports researchers using in their data-intensive work and reduces manual overhead. It can be used as a decision-making tool to assess and document potential vulnerabilities in code for data processing. Ultimately, our work contributes to an increased security and overall transparency of data processing activities within the PHT framework.},

	abstract = {The European Commission's draft for the European Health Data Space (EHDS) aims to empower citizens to access their personal health data and share it with physicians and other health-care providers. It further defines procedures for the secondary use of electronic health data for research and development. Although this planned legislation is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, implementation approaches could potentially result in centralised data silos that pose data privacy and security risks for individuals. To address this concern, we propose federated personal health data spaces, a novel architecture for storing, managing, and sharing personal electronic health records that puts citizens at the centre-both conceptually and technologically. The proposed architecture puts citizens in control by storing personal health data on a combination of personal devices rather than in centralised data silos. We describe how this federated architecture fits within the EHDS and can enable the same features as centralised systems while protecting the privacy of citizens. We further argue that increased privacy and control do not contradict the use of electronic health data for research and development. Instead, data sovereignty and transparency encourage active participation in studies and data sharing. This combination of privacy-by-design and transparent, privacy-preserving data sharing can enable health-care leaders to break the privacy-exploitation barrier, which currently limits the secondary use of health data in many cases.},

To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, computing paradigms have promoted a transformative shift from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then thoroughly examine FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part.

To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, the JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed.In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python object classes. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters, and its growing user community.The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata-handling functionality to support automation, a common interface, and an interoperable medium between the 2 ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.},

Although several studies have proposed methods to distribute the computation or aggregate results, few efforts have been made to cover on how to implement FL pipelines. With the aim of accelerating the exploitation of FL frameworks, this paper proposes a survey of public tools that are currently available for building FL pipelines, an objective ranking based on the current state of user preferences, and an assessment of the growing trend of the tool’s popularity over a one year time window, with measurements performed every six months. These measurements include objective metrics, like the number of “Watch,” “Star” and “Follow” available from software repositories as well as thirteen custom metrics grouped into three main categories: Usability, Portability, and Flexibility. Finally, a ranking of the maturity of the tools is derived based on the key aspects to consider when building a FL pipeline.},

	abstract = {Background: The rapid advancement of deep learning in health care presents significant opportunities for automating complex medical tasks and improving clinical workflows. However, widespread adoption is impeded by data privacy concerns and the necessity for large, diverse datasets across multiple institutions. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a viable solution, enabling collaborative artificial intelligence model development without sharing individual patient data. To effectively implement FL in health care, robust and secure infrastructures are essential. Developing such federated deep learning frameworks is crucial to harnessing the full potential of artificial intelligence while ensuring patient data privacy and regulatory compliance.
Objective: The objective is to introduce an innovative FL infrastructure called the Personal Health Train (PHT) that includes the procedural, technical, and governance components needed to implement FL on real-world health care data, including training deep learning neural networks. The study aims to apply this federated deep learning infrastructure to the use case of gross tumor volume segmentation on chest computed tomography images of patients with lung cancer and present the results from a proof-of-concept experiment.
Methods: The PHT framework addresses the challenges of data privacy when sharing data, by keeping data close to the source and instead bringing the analysis to the data. Technologically, PHT requires 3 interdependent components: “tracks” (protected communication channels), “trains” (containerized software apps), and “stations” (institutional data repositories), which are supported by the open source “Vantage6” software. The study applies this federated deep learning infrastructure to the use case of gross tumor volume segmentation on chest computed tomography images of patients with lung cancer, with the introduction of an additional component called the secure aggregation server, where the model averaging is done in a trusted and inaccessible environment.
Results: We demonstrated the feasibility of executing deep learning algorithms in a federated manner using PHT and presented the results from a proof-of-concept study. The infrastructure linked 12 hospitals across 8 nations, covering 4 continents, demonstrating the scalability and global reach of the proposed approach. During the execution and training of the deep learning algorithm, no data were shared outside the hospital.
Conclusions: The findings of the proof-of-concept study, as well as the implications and limitations of the infrastructure and the results, are discussed. The application of federated deep learning to unstructured medical imaging data, facilitated by the PHT framework and Vantage6 platform, represents a significant advancement in the field. The proposed infrastructure addresses the challenges of data privacy and enables collaborative model development, paving the way for the widespread adoption of deep learning–based tools in the medical domain and beyond. The introduction of the secure aggregation server implied that data leakage problems in FL can be prevented by careful design decisions of the infrastructure.

Cumulus software is designed to address key technology and policy desiderata including local utility, control, and administrative simplicity as well as privacy preservation during robust data sharing, and artificial intelligence (AI) for processing unstructured text.Cumulus relies on containerized, cloud-hosted software, installed within a healthcare organization’s security envelope. Cumulus accesses EHR data via the Bulk FHIR interface and streamlines automated processing and sharing. The modular design enables use of the latest AI and natural language processing tools and supports provider autonomy and administrative simplicity. In an initial test, Cumulus was deployed across 5 healthcare systems each partnered with public health. Cumulus output is patient counts which were aggregated into a table stratifying variables of interest to enable population health studies. All code is available open source. A policy stipulating that only aggregate data leave the institution greatly facilitated data sharing agreements.Cumulus addresses barriers to data sharing based on (1) federally required support for standard APIs, (2) increasing use of cloud computing, and (3) advances in AI.

The contributions of this paper are (1) the speciﬁcation of multiple enterprise architecture models as ontological schemas, (2) the integration of ontological schemas, and (3) the analysis of the integrated models.

At equal communication budgets (total edges), HSL achieves higher performance than ELL, while at significantly lower communication budgets, it can match ELL's performance. For instance, with only 400 edges, HSL reaches the same test accuracy that ELL achieves with 1000 edges for 100 peers (spokes) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating its suitability for resource-constrained systems. HSL also achieves stronger consensus among nodes after mixing, resulting in improved performance with fewer training rounds.

This is especially hard because data is scattered and there are limits on how data can be sent across borders. Data Mesh, a new way of thinking about data architecture, offers a solution to this problem by offering a decentralized way of managing data that can make it easier to put together data in a local context. In this paper, we discuss the problems that organizations face when trying to manage data localization with respect to the data regulations in different regions, the problems with traditional approaches to data management, and the benefits of using a data mesh architecture to gather data. We also discuss a region-based unified data mesh architecture that was made with data localization in mind, pointing out its most important parts and benefits. Our proposed unified data mesh abstraction model can help organizations to deal with the problems caused by data localization and use their data assets to make better decisions and get better insights.},

	abstract = {Models have long since been used, in different shapes and forms, to understand, communicate about, and (re)shape, the world around us; including many different social, economic, biological, chemical, physical, and digital aspects. This is also the case in the context of enterprise architecture (EA), where we see a wide range of models in many different shapes and forms being used as well. Researchers in EA modeling usually introduce their own lexicon, and perspective of what a model actually is, while accepting (often implicitly) the accompanying ontological commitments. Similarly, practitioners of EA modeling implicitly also commit to (different) ontologies, resulting in models that have an uncertain ontological standing. This is because, for the subject domain of enterprise architecture models (as opposed to the content of such models), no single ontology has gained major traction. As a result, studies into aspects of enterprise architecture models, such as “model quality” and “return on modeling effort”, are fragmented, and cannot readily be compared or combined. This paper proposes a comprehensive applied ontology, specifically geared to enterprise architecture modeling. Ontologies represent structured knowledge about a particular subject domain. It allows for study into, and reasoning about, that subject domain. Our ontology is derived from a theory of modeling, while clarifying concepts such as “enterprise architecture model”, and introduces novel concepts such as “model audience” and “model objective”. Furthermore, the relevant interrelations between these different concepts are identified and defined. The resulting ontology for enterprise architecture models is represented in OntoUML, and shown to be consistent with the foundational ontology for modeling, Unified Foundational Ontology.},

	abstract = {A main challenge for artificial intelligence in scientific research is ensuring access to sufficient, high-quality data for the development of impactful models. Despite the abundance of public data, the most valuable knowledge often remains embedded within confidential corporate data silos. Although industries are increasingly open to sharing non-competitive insights, such collaboration is often constrained by the confidentiality of the underlying data. Federated learning makes it possible to share knowledge without compromising data privacy, but it has notable limitations. Here, we introduce FLuID (federated learning using information distillation), a data-centric application of federated distillation tailored to drug discovery aiming to preserve data privacy. We validate FLuID in two experiments, first involving public data simulating a virtual consortium and second in a real-world research collaboration between eight pharmaceutical companies. Although the alignment of the models with the partner specific domain remains challenging, the data-driven nature of FLuID offers several avenues to mitigate domain shift. FLuID fosters knowledge sharing among pharmaceutical organizations, paving the way for a new generation of models with enhanced performance and an expanded applicability domain in biological activity predictions.},

Federated learning is a decentralized approach to training models across multiple local clients without the exchange of raw data from client devices to global servers. However, existing works focus on a static data environment and ignore continual learning from streaming data with incremental tasks. Federated Continual Learning (FCL) is an emerging paradigm to address model learning in both federated and continual learning environments. The key objective of FCL is to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from different clients and retain knowledge of previous tasks while learning on new ones. In this work, we delineate federated learning and continual learning first and then discuss their integration, i.e., FCL, and particular FCL via knowledge fusion. In summary, our motivations are four-fold: we (1) raise a fundamental problem called “spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting” and evaluate its impact on the performance using a well-known method called federated averaging (FedAvg), (2) integrate most of the existing FCL methods into two generic frameworks, namely synchronous FCL and asynchronous FCL, (3) categorize a large number of methods according to the mechanism involved in knowledge fusion, and finally (4) showcase an outlook on the future work of FCL.},

However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices, and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology that enables collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be “reverse engineered” to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this privacy premise does not hold. In this article we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which the privacy of an FL client can be broken. We further dissect some of the successful industry applications of FL and draw lessons for future successful adoption. We survey the emerging landscape of privacy regulation for FL and conclude with future directions for taking FL toward the cherished goal of generating accurate models while preserving the privacy of the data from its participants.},

	abstract = {Event-based analytics is increasingly gaining prominence in business and social applications. Despite the availability of many solutions specializing in event processing systems (e.g. CEP technology), there is currently no commonly agreed way of describing event and event pattern types, and thus no standardized method for interchange of event pattern instances between systems. This paper advocates an open architecture for event-based analytics comprising a common model that supports interoperability of data between different systems. It introduces the foundational concepts for describing event patterns including events, event pattern types and event pattern occurrences. The event pattern meta-model is also formalized using a UML meta-model to facilitate its adoption and usage across the event analytics community. The paper provides a case study introducing several event pattern types from the financial market data analytics domain. This case study illustrates a number of specific event pattern types used by finance experts and an application that requires interoperability between two separate software component frameworks (a rule-based front-end and a CEP). Results show that the meta-model concepts are sufficient to represent and implement a class of real-life business analytics solutions. The paper also identified a number of semantic challenges in developing interoperability solutions for the event-based processing, in spite of the fact that we needed to merge only two separately developed event-based conceptual models.},

Despite its pioneering nature, FL faces issues such as diversity in data types, model complexity, privacy concerns, and the need for efficient resource distribution. This paper illustrates an empirical analysis of these challenges within specially designed scenarios, each aimed at studying a specific problem.

	abstract = {Machine learning model accuracy, generalization, and reliability are greatly affected by the training data quality. High-quality data-characterized by completeness, consistency, accuracy, representativeness and homogeneity enables meaningful pattern learning and robust prediction. In federated learning (FL), the learning process is collaborative and conducted across decentralized and locally private data nodes. The heterogeneity of data across these nodes degrade model performance and may lead to overfitting, underfitting, and erroneous decision-making. Heterogeneity is caused by inconsistent labeling, missing values, and class imbalances across these nodes. Proper data preparation, including cleaning, normalization, and augmentation, is essential to mitigate these issues and ensure that these distributed datasets reflect the problem domain accurately. The raw data, which is generated from diverse sources with the fundamental constraint that this data cannot be shared among learning nodes exacerbates these challenges. Although data preparation has received great interest in recent years; little attention has been given to data challenges posed when FL is used. Although some surveys mention FL challenges, it is discussed superficially. These papers predominantly focus on one aspect of data challenges such as quality, homogeneity or balance discussing FL within the context of these specific challenges. No recent survey examine all data-related challenges in FL, including their interdependencies and interactions. To address these limitations, the main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive overview of data challenges in FL, encompassing data heterogeneity, skewness, representation, quality, bias, and fairness. The paper begins by identifying the data challenges highlighted in the existing literature, with a particular focus on the interrelationships among these challenges, which are categorized into two main groups: non-independently and non-identically distributed (Non-IID) data issues and data quality issues. Subsequently, the paper reviews and compares recognized data challenges solution approaches exploring additional data preparation techniques that could serve as candidate solutions. The paper aims to define the necessary work to optimize the effectiveness of these techniques with respect to distributed and isolated data in FL.},

	abstract = {Successful collaboration involves sharing information. However, parties may disagree on how the information they need to share should be used. We argue that many of these concerns reduce to 'the copy problem': once a bit of information is copied and shared, the sender can no longer control how the recipient uses it. From the perspective of each collaborator, this presents a dilemma that can inhibit collaboration. The copy problem is often amplified by three related problems which we term the bundling, edit, and recursive enforcement problems. We find that while the copy problem is not solvable, aspects of these amplifying problems have been addressed in a variety of disconnected fields. We observe that combining these efforts could improve the governability of information flows and thereby incentivise collaboration. We propose a five-part framework which groups these efforts into specific capabilities and offers a foundation for their integration into an overarching vision we call "structured transparency". We conclude by surveying an array of use-cases that illustrate the structured transparency principles and their related capabilities.},

Despite the significant success of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in advanced melanoma, substantial variability in clinical responses to these treatments emphasizes the need for personalized approaches to therapy.Materials and MethodsIn this pilot study, 239 patients with melanoma were included to predict the response to both targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We used machine learning (ML) to incorporate RWD and applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to explain the individual predictions.ResultsWe developed, validated, and compared four ML models to evaluate 2-year survival using RWD. Our research showed encouraging outcomes, achieving an AUC of more than 80\% and an estimated accuracy of over 74\% across the four ML models. The random forest model exhibited the highest performance in predicting 2-year survival with an AUC of 0.85. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations was used to explain individual predictions and provide trust and insights into the clinical implications of the ML model.ConclusionWith this proof-of-concept, we integrated RWD into predictive modeling using ML techniques to predict clinical outcomes and explore their potential implications for clinical decision making. The potential of XAI was demonstrated to enhance trust and improve the usability of the model in clinical settings. Further research, including foundation modeling and generative AI, will likely increase the predictive power of prognostic and predictive ML models in advanced melanoma.},

We propose an extract, transform, load (ETL) framework that is metadata-driven and generic across source datasets. The ETL framework uses a new data manipulation language (DML) that organizes SQL snippets in YAML. Our framework includes a compiler that converts YAML files with mapping logic into an ETL script. Access to the ETL framework is available via a web application, allowing users to upload and edit YAML files via web editor and obtain an ETL SQL script for use in development environments. The structure of the DML maximizes readability, refactoring, and maintainability, while minimizing technical debt and standardizing the writing of ETL operations for mapping to OMOP.

	abstract = {Objective The German Health Data Lab is going to provide access to German statutory health insurance claims data ranging from 2009 to the present for research purposes. Due to evolving data formats within the German Health Data Lab, there is a need to standardize this data into a Common Data Model to facilitate collaborative health research and minimize the need for researchers to adapt to multiple data formats. For this purpose we selected transforming the data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Methods We developed an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline for two distinct German Health Data Lab data formats: Format 1 (2009-2016) and Format 3 (2019 onwards). Due to the identical format structure of Format 1 and Format 2 (2017 -2018), the ETL pipeline of Format 1 can be applied on Format 2 as well. Our ETL process, supported by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools, includes specification development, SQL skeleton creation, and concept mapping. We detail the process characteristics and present a quality assessment that includes field coverage and concept mapping accuracy using example data. Results For Format 1, we achieved a field coverage of 92.7\%. The Data Quality Dashboard showed 100.0\% conformance and 80.6\% completeness, although plausibility checks were disabled. The mapping coverage for the Condition domain was low at 18.3\% due to invalid codes and missing mappings in the provided example data. For Format 3, the field coverage was 86.2\%, with Data Quality Dashboard reporting 99.3\% conformance and 75.9\% completeness. The Procedure domain had very low mapping coverage (2.2\%) due to the use of mocked data and unmapped local concepts The Condition domain results with 99.8\% of unique codes mapped. The absence of real data limits the comprehensive assessment of quality. Conclusion The ETL process effectively transforms the data with high field coverage and conformance. It simplifies data utilization for German Health Data Lab users and enhances the use of OHDSI analysis tools. This initiative represents a significant step towards facilitating cross-border research in Europe by providing publicly available, standardized ETL processes (https://github.com/FraunhoferMEVIS/ETLfromHDLtoOMOP) and evaluations of their performance.},

	abstract = {The increasing complexity and volume of organizational data have led to the emergence of the Data Mesh paradigm, a data architecture with a federated governance aimed at addressing the limitations of traditional monolithic data systems that has overlapping principles with the microservices architectural style. Although related work exists, the majority of architectural approaches regarding Data Mesh are conceptual, technology-centric or vendor speciﬁc. This paper introduces a Data Mesh Reference Architecture (RA) using the ArchiMate enterprise architecture modeling language, designed to assist organizations in implementing (or migrating towards) data mesh solutions. The RA comprises three main components: domain architecture, self-serve data platform architecture, and federated governance, which reﬂect the main Data Mesh principles. Through a systematic literature review, four data mesh archetypes (Pure, Semi-Pure, Hybrid, and Distributed) were identiﬁed, along with challenges, limitations, and motivational factors for adoption. A questionnaire-based validation among experts conﬁrmed the RA’s utility, quality, and variability. However, practical validation was not conducted within this study. The study contributes to both literature and practice by oﬀering a structured approach and a set of reference models for designing data mesh architectures. Future research can contribute to practical validation, assessment of RA-driven design eﬃciency, and extending the RA with domain-driven solution architectures.},

This distributed model ensures the privacy of data at each local node. Owing to its relevance, there has been extensive research activities and outcomes in federated learning with expanded applicability to different areas by the research community. As such, there is a vast research archive made available by the community with research work and articles related to the various aspects of federated learning such as applications, challenges, privacy, functionalities, and design. With respect to the function and design of federated learning, client selection, aggregation, knowledge transfer, management of distributed data (Non-IID), Incentive of data and communication cost are of paramount importance. Any effective design of federated learning requires these aspects to be well considered. There are numerous survey articles found among the available literature that focus on its application and challenges, opportunities, data privacy and protection, as well as on federated learning on internet of things, federated learning on edge computing, etc. In this paper, a review of the available literature on the various elements of design and functionalities in federated learning has been carried out with an aim to lay emphasis on the important challenges and research opportunities. More specifically, this work has endeavored to understand and summarize the various functional methods available, along with their techniques and goals. Additionally, it has strived to get a bird’s eye view of how various functions and designs of federated learning have been used in applications, and how it has helped uncover challenges and promising research directions for the future.},

	abstract = {The data generated and stored in mobile devices owned by individuals as well as in various organizations contains a large amount of valuable and important information that can be used to improve service quality, user experience, and satisfaction. However, due to privacy concerns, many entities are reluctant to share their data with others, and this is a major barrier to developing comprehensive models that can provide accurate predictions. Federated learning is a state-of-the-art distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients are allowed to collaboratively train a model while keeping their private training data locally. Although federated learning seems to be a viable solution for jointly training a machine learning model without compromising privacy, sensitive privacy information may still be leaked through shared model parameters and query results. Over the past six years, the researchers have extensively studied privacy protection enhancements of federated learning, and they have revealed that general privacy protection mechanisms can be adopted to mitigate privacy issues of federated learning. However, protecting privacy through federated learning while maintaining data utility is still an open issue. This article provides an overview of federated learning while discussing privacy leakages, possible defense mechanisms, and future research directions of privacy-preserved federated learning.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is creating a paradigm shift in machine learning by directing the focus of model training to where the data actually exist. Instead of drawing all data into a central location, which raises concerns about privacy, costs, and delays, FL allows learning to take place directly on the device, keeping the data safe and minimizing the need for transfer. This approach is especially important in areas like healthcare, where protecting patient privacy is critical, and in industrial IoT settings, where moving large numbers of data is not practical. What makes FL even more compelling is its ability to reduce the bias that can occur when all data are centralized, leading to fairer and more inclusive machine learning outcomes. However, it is not without its challenges—particularly with regard to keeping the models secure from attacks. Nonetheless, the potential benefits are clear: FL can lower the costs associated with data storage and processing, while also helping organizations to meet strict privacy regulations like GDPR. As edge computing continues to grow, FL’s decentralized approach could play a key role in shaping how we handle data in the future, moving toward a more privacy-conscious world. This study identifies ongoing challenges in ensuring model security against adversarial attacks, pointing to the need for further research in this area.},

On-device computations combined with other privacy and security measures ensure that only minimal data is transmitted off-device, achieving a high standard of data protection. Despite FA's broad relevance, the applicability of existing FA systems is limited by compromised accuracy; lack of flexibility for data analytics; and an inability to scale effectively. In this paper, we describe our approach to combine privacy, scalability, and practicality to build and deploy a system that overcomes these limitations. Our FA system leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) and optimizes the use of on-device computing resources to facilitate federated data processing across large fleets of devices, while ensuring robust, defensible, and verifiable privacy safeguards. We focus on federated analytics (statistics and monitoring), in contrast to systems for federated learning (ML workloads), and we flag the key differences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reuse of data from electronic health records (EHRs) for research purposes promises to improve the data foundation for clinical trials and may even support to enable them. Nevertheless, EHRs are characterized by both, heterogeneous structure and semantics. To standardize this data for research, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) standard has recently seen an increase in use. However, the conversion of these EHRs into the OMOP CDM requires complex and resource intensive Extract Transform and Load (ETL) processes. This hampers the reuse of clinical data for research. To solve the issues of heterogeneity of EHRs and the lack of semantic precision on the care site, the openEHR standard has recently seen wider adoption. A standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the CDM potentially lowers the barriers of making EHRs accessible for research. Yet, a comprehensive approach about the integration of openEHR records into the OMOP CDM has not yet been made.
METHODS: We analyzed both standards and compared their models to identify possible mappings. Based on this, we defined the necessary processes to transform openEHR records into CDM tables. We also discuss the limitation of openEHR with its unspecific demographics model and propose two possible solutions.
RESULTS: We developed the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) which enabled us to define a declarative openEHR archetype-to-CDM mapping language. Using OMOCL, it was possible to define a set of mappings. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the Eos tool, which uses the OMOCL-files to successfully automatize the ETL from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM.
DISCUSSION: Both Eos and OMOCL provide a way to define generic mappings for an integration of openEHR records into OMOP. Thus, it represents a significant step towards achieving interoperability between the clinical and the research data domains. However, the transformation of openEHR data into the less expressive OMOP CDM leads to a loss of semantics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To gain insight into the real-life care of patients in the healthcare system, data from hospital information systems and insurance systems are required. Consequently, linking clinical data with claims data is necessary. To ensure their syntactic and semantic interoperability, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community was chosen. However, there is no detailed guide that would allow researchers to follow a generic process for data harmonization, i.e. the transformation of local source data into the standardized OMOP CDM format. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conceptualize a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM.
METHODS: For this purpose, we conducted a literature review focusing on publications that address the harmonization of clinical or claims data in OMOP CDM. Subsequently, the process steps used and their chronological order as well as applied OHDSI tools were extracted for each included publication. The results were then compared to derive a generic sequence of the process steps.
RESULTS: From 23 publications included, a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM was conceptualized, consisting of nine process steps: dataset specification, data profiling, vocabulary identification, coverage analysis of vocabularies, semantic mapping, structural mapping, extract-transform-load-process, qualitative and quantitative data quality analysis. Furthermore, we identified seven OHDSI tools which supported five of the process steps.
CONCLUSIONS: The generic data harmonization process can be used as a step-by-step guide to assist other researchers in harmonizing source data in OMOP CDM.},

The first is to introduce the innovative work of David Bollier and Silke Helfrich in theorizing and researching the commons. The second is to explore the possibilities and constraints of the commons and the process of commoning as they unfold in real-world political-economic settings. Bollier and Helfrich have formulated a remarkable, ‘in-the-round’, moral-empirical theory of the commons. In their social ontology, peer governance and moral economy commons form a subversive alternative to the capitalist order. Bollier and Helfrich’s theory restores an older tradition of a moral critique of capitalism in the tradition of “moral economists” such as Karl Polanyi and H.P. Tawney. It raises important questions about the socio-ethical foundations of our society and economy, the relationship between civil associations and the state, and the nature of the state. In the final part of this introduction, we discuss the complex relationship between the commons and the state. We frame this relationship as one of mutual dependency and argue for the careful redesign of our institutions of public administration and democratic governance to make them more receptive and accessible to the creative powers of the commons. Finally, we introduce the contributions to this special issue, including a reflective concluding essay by David Bolllier.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative analysis of decentralized medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, the covariate shift from demographic and clinical differences can reduce model generalizability. We propose FedWeight, a novel FL framework that mitigates covariate shift by reweighting patient data from the source sites using density estimators, allowing the trained model to better align with the distribution of the target site. To support unsupervised applications, we introduce FedWeight ETM, a federated embedded topic model. We evaluated FedWeight in cross-site FL on the eICU dataset and cross-dataset FL between eICU and MIMIC III. FedWeight consistently outperforms standard FL baselines in predicting ICU mortality, ventilator use, sepsis diagnosis, and length of stay. SHAP-based interpretation and ETM-based topic modeling reveal improved identification of clinically relevant characteristics and disease topics associated with ICU readmission.},

	abstract = {Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better understand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent items. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns, statistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection, solves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and report the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP complicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the injected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by perturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel target-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying ε-LDP, for federated heavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension strategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and estimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present a consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from other parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters in each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the global ones. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first solution to the federated heavy hitter analytics in a cross-party setting while satisfying the stringent ε-LDP. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.},

	abstract = {Background:
The reuse of data from electronic health records (EHRs) for research purposes promises to improve the data foundation for clinical trials and may even support to enable them. Nevertheless, EHRs are characterized by both, heterogeneous structure and semantics. To standardize this data for research, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) standard has recently seen an increase in use. However, the conversion of these EHRs into the OMOP CDM requires complex and resource intensive Extract Transform and Load (ETL) processes. This hampers the reuse of clinical data for research. To solve the issues of heterogeneity of EHRs and the lack of semantic precision on the care site, the openEHR standard has recently seen wider adoption. A standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the CDM potentially lowers the barriers of making EHRs accessible for research. Yet, a comprehensive approach about the integration of openEHR records into the OMOP CDM has not yet been made.
Methods:
We analyzed both standards and compared their models to identify possible mappings. Based on this, we defined the necessary processes to transform openEHR records into CDM tables. We also discuss the limitation of openEHR with its unspecific demographics model and propose two possible solutions.
Results:
We developed the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) which enabled us to define a declarative openEHR archetype-to-CDM mapping language. Using OMOCL, it was possible to define a set of mappings. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the Eos tool, which uses the OMOCL-files to successfully automatize the ETL from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM.
Discussion:
Both Eos and OMOCL provide a way to define generic mappings for an integration of openEHR records into OMOP. Thus, it represents a significant step towards achieving interoperability between the clinical and the research data domains. However, the transformation of openEHR data into the less expressive OMOP CDM leads to a loss of semantics.},

Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.},

To realize its potential for AI development on clinical data, a number of bottlenecks need to be addressed. One of these is making data Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable (FAIR). The primary aim of this work is to show that tools making data FAIR allow consortia to collaborate on privacy-aware data exploration, data visualization, and training of models on each other’s original data.We propose a “Schema-on-Read” FAIR-ification method that adapts for different (re)analyses without needing to change the underlying original data. The procedure involves (1) decoupling the contents of the data from its schema and database structure, (2) annotation with semantic ontologies as a metadata layer, and (3) readout using semantic queries. Open-source tools are given as Docker containers to help local investigators prepare their data on-premises.We created a federated privacy-preserving visualization dashboard for case mix exploration of 5 distributed datasets with no common schema at the point of origin. We demonstrated robust and flexible prognostication model development and validation, linking together different data sources—clinical risk factors and radiomics.Our procedure leads to successful (re)use of data in FL-based consortia without the need to impose a common schema at every point of origin of data.This work supports the adoption of FL within the healthcare AI community by sharing means to make data more FAIR.},

Out of a total of 22,693 articles under review, 612 articles are included in the final analysis. The majority of articles are proof-of-concepts studies, and only 5.2\% are studies with real-life application of FL. Radiology and internal medicine are the most common specialties involved in FL. FL is robust to a variety of machine learning models and data types, with neural networks and medical imaging being the most common, respectively. We highlight the need to address the barriers to clinical translation and to assess its real-world impact in this new digital data-driven healthcare scene.},

Our work aims to provide a framework and tooling where users can easily make their data (more) FAIR. This framework uses RDF and OWL-based inferencing to annotate existing databases or comma-separated files. For every database, a custom ontology is build based on the database schema, which can be annotated to describe matching standardized terminologies. In this work, we describe the tooling developed, and the current implementation in an institutional datawarehouse pertaining over 3000 rectal cancer patients. We report on the performance (time) of the extraction and annotation process by the developed tooling. Furthermore, we do show that annotation of existing databases using OWL2-based reasoning is possible. Furthermore, we show that the ontology extracted from existing databases can provide a description framework to describe and annotate existing data sources. This would target mostly the “Interoperable” aspect of FAIR.},

              Summary
              Extensive human health data from cohort studies, national registries, and biobanks can reveal lifecourse risk factors impacting health. Combining these sources offers increased statistical power, rare outcome detection, replication of findings, and extended study periods. Traditionally, this required data transfer to a central location or separate partner analyses with pooled summary statistics, posing ethical, legal, and time constraints. Federated analysis—which involves remote data analysis without sharing individual-level data—is a promising alternative. One promising solution is DataSHIELD (https://datashield.org/), an open-source R based implementation. To enable federated analysis, data owners need a user-friendly way to install the federated infrastructure and manage users and data. Here, we present MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis solutions such as DataSHIELD.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              Armadillo is implemented as a collection of three packages freely available under the open source licence LGPLv3: two R packages downloadable from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (“MolgenisArmadillo” and “DSMolgenisArmdillo”) and one Java application (“ArmadilloService”) as jar and docker images via Github (https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo).},

To ease the process of deploying such a secure data infrastructure, we present a detailed documentation of the architecture and processes of such an infrastructure and provide a pre-configured reference implementation based entirely on open source software that can be flexibly configured to meet differing security requirements and deployment scenarios.We combine mechanisms for data visiting on secured infrastructure components with optional components of data anonymization and fingerprinting, covered by extensive logging and monitoring functions and embedded in defined processes and contractual frameworks. The set-up is based upon the experience of operating such a secure infrastructure in the medical domain for almost ten years, addressing the emerging need to make such a solution available to a larger set of stakeholders.

We show how EOSC‐Life provides a model for sustainable data management according to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles, including solutions for sensitive‐ and industry‐related resources, by means of cross‐disciplinary training and best practices sharing.

This paper describes the design principles and the different building blocks that have supported the implementation and deployment of Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI), the strengths and challenges of the approach and some future developments.The design and implementation of PHIRI have been developed upon: (i) the data visiting principle—data does not move but code moves; (ii) the orchestration of the research question throughout a workflow that ensured legal, organizational, semantic and technological interoperability and (iii) a ‘master–worker’ federated computational architecture that supported the development of four uses cases.Nine participants nodes and 28 Euro-Peristat members completed the deployment of the infrastructure according to the expected outputs. As a consequence, each use case produced and published their own common data model, the analytical pipeline and the corresponding research outputs. All the digital objects were developed and published according to Open Science and FAIR principles.PHIRI has successfully supported the development of four use cases in a federated manner, overcoming limitations for the reuse of sensitive health data and providing a methodology to achieve interoperability in multiple research nodes.},

Its practical application in real-world medical scenarios is, however, hindered by privacy concerns and data heterogeneity. To address these issues without compromising privacy, federated partially supervised segmentation (FPSS) is formulated in this work. The primary challenges for FPSS are class heterogeneity and client drift. We propose a uniﬁed federated partially labeled segmentation (UFPS) framework to segment pixels within all classes for partially annotated datasets by training a comprehensive global model that avoids class collision. Our framework includes uniﬁed label learning (ULL) and sparse uniﬁed sharpness aware minimization (sUSAM) for class and feature space uniﬁcation, respectively. Through empirical studies, we ﬁnd that traditional methods in partially supervised segmentation and federated learning often struggle with class collision when combined. Our extensive experiments on real medical datasets demonstrate better deconﬂicting and generalization capabilities of UFPS.},

By leveraging distributionally robust optimization and a uniﬁed uncertainty set, it ensures consistent performance across all subpopulations and enhances the overall efﬁcacy of FL in healthcare and other domains while maintaining accuracy levels comparable with those of existing methods. Our model was validated by applying it to four digital healthcare tasks using real-world datasets in federated settings. Our collaborative machine learning paradigm not only promotes artiﬁcial intelligence in digital healthcare but also fosters social equity by embodying fairness.},

	abstract = {The amount of biomedical data continues to grow rapidly. However, collecting data from multiple sites for joint analysis remains challenging due to security, privacy, and regulatory concerns. To overcome this challenge, we use federated learning, which enables distributed training of neural network models over multiple data sources without sharing data. Each site trains the neural network over its private data for some time and then shares the neural network parameters (i.e., weights and/or gradients) with a federation controller, which in turn aggregates the local models and sends the resulting community model back to each site, and the process repeats. Our federated learning architecture, MetisFL, provides strong security and privacy. First, sample data never leave a site. Second, neural network parameters are encrypted before transmission and the global neural model is computed under fully homomorphic encryption. Finally, we use information-theoretic methods to limit information leakage from the neural model to prevent a ‘‘curious’’ site from performing model inversion or membership attacks. We present a thorough evaluation of the performance of secure, private federated learning in neuroimaging tasks, including for predicting Alzheimer’s disease and for brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in challenging, heterogeneous federated environments where sites have different amounts of data and statistical distributions.},

Federated learning (FL) provides a promising framework for building predictive models by leveraging the data from multiple institutions without sharing them. However, data distribution drift across different institutions greatly impacts the performance of FL. In this paper, an adaptive FL framework was proposed to address this challenge. Our framework separated the input features into stable, domain-speciﬁc, and conditional-irrelevant parts according to their relationships to clinical outcomes. We evaluate this framework on the tasks of predicting the onset risk of sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) from multiple clinical institutions. The results showed that our framework can achieve better prediction performance compared with existing FL baselines and provide reasonable feature interpretations.},

Federated approaches augment these approaches by enabling access or more sophisticated, shareable and scaled-up analyses of large-scale data. We examined GM alterations using Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation, an open-source, decentralized analysis application. Through federated analysis of eight sites, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant overlap in the GM patterns (n = 4,102) of individuals with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

We compare the simulated performance of several models trained using FL against classically trained ML models on the task of multi-omics Parkinson’s disease prediction.

We also determine that the dispersion of samples within a federation plays a meaningful role in model performance.

The complementarity between LLMs and FL has already ignited widespread research interest. In this review, we aim to deeply explore the integration of LLMs and FL. We propose a research framework dividing the fusion of LLMs and FL into three parts: the combination of LLM sub-technologies with FL, the integration of FL sub-technologies with LLMs, and the overall merger of LLMs and FL. We ﬁrst provide a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the domain of LLMs combined with FL, including their typical applications, integration advantages, challenges faced, and future directions for resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the practical applications of the combination of LLMs and FL in critical scenarios such as healthcare, ﬁnance, and education and provide new perspectives and insights into future research directions for LLMs and FL.},

Nevertheless, DL requires large datasets that often must be pooled from different institutions, raising non-trivial privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) is a cooperative learning paradigm that aims to address these issues by moving models instead of data across different institutions. Here, we present a federated multi-input architecture using images and tabular data as a methodology to enhance model performance while preserving data privacy. We evaluated it on two showcases: the prognosis of COVID-19 and patients’ stratiﬁcation in Alzheimer’s disease, providing evidence of enhanced accuracy and F1 scores against single-input models and improved generalizability against nonfederated models.},

Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.},

This study addresses the challenges of model generalizability in Head and Neck cancer research by utilizing combined clinical and radiomics data from centers in India and the Netherlands, following Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable (F.A.I.R.) data principles. We use Vantage6, a federated learning software infrastructure that implements the Personal Health Train (PHT) paradigm to ensure data privacy and security during collaborative research. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and LASSO regularized Cox regression were used to identify key features in training Cox proportional hazards models to predict Overall Survival (OS), Distant Metastasis (DM), and Locoregional Recurrence (LRR) in six datasets totaling 1131 oropharyngeal cancer patients. Our results highlight the efficacy of federated learning in providing a secure environment for multi-centric cancer research, enabling the development and validation of predictive models while upholding patient data confidentiality.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, data-driven medicine has gained increasing importance in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and research due to the exponential growth of healthcare data. The linkage of cross-border health data from various sources, including genomics, and analysis via innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will allow a better understanding of risk factors, causes, and the development of optimal treatment in different disease areas. However, the reuse of patient data is often limited to data sets available in a single medical center. The main reasons why health data are not shared across institutional boundaries rely on ethical, legal, and privacy aspects and rules. Therefore, in order to (1) enable the sharing of health data across national borders, (2) fully comply with the current GDPR privacy guidelines/regulations, and (3) innovate by pushing research beyond state of the art, BETTER proposes a robust decentralized privacy preservation infrastructure which will empower researchers, innovators, and healthcare professionals to exploit the full potential of larger sets of multisource health data through tailored AI tools useful to compare, integrate, and analyze in a secure, cost-effective fashion; with the end goal of supporting the improvement of citizen health outcomes. In detail, this interdisciplinary project proposes the co-creation of three clinical use cases involving seven medical centers located in the EU and beyond, where sensitive patient data, including genomics, are made available and analyzed in a GDPR-compliant mechanism via a Distributed Analytics (DA) paradigm called the Personal Health Train (PHT). The main principle of the PHT is that the analytical task is brought to the data provider (medical center), and the data instances remain in their original location. In this project, two mature implementations of the PHT (PADME and Vantage6), already validated in real-world scenarios, will be fused to build the BETTER platform.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is advancing cancer research by enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models on diverse, multi-centre data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Unlike previous surveys, we critically evaluate FL’s real-world implementation and impact, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability and performance in clinical settings. Our analysis reveals that FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of 25 studies, spanning diverse models and clinical applications, including multi-modal integration for precision medicine. Despite challenges identified in reproducibility and standardisation, FL demonstrates substantial potential for advancing cancer research. We propose future research focus on addressing these limitations and investigating advanced FL methods to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.},
