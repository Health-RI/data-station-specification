# Specification overview

## Introduction to Health-RI

Health-RI is a national initiative in the Netherlands dedicated to building an integrated infrastructure for health and life sciences data. By improving data sharing, reuse, and accessibility, Health-RI aims to empower researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to accelerate data-driven healthcare innovation.

The following specification outlines the reusable architectural practices that constitute a **composable data station**. The specification is intended to be constantly evolving as standards and implementer needs change over time.

## Specification purpose

The purpose of the specification is to:

- Provide an overview of the architecture of a composable data station as a foundation building block for secondary health data sharing
- Articulate the requirements of the components of such data stations
- Articulate the workflows that are currently used implementing data stations and using the data stations within a federated analytics network
- Provide a reference for implementers to use in their architecture and/or implementations
